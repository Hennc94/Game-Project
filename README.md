*Minimal Viable Product*

- Get pieces to move along board in every direction.
- Pieces start from the bottom up, just like the board game.
- Declare a winner once four pieces have been matched.

# PMVP
*Post Minimal Viable Product*
  - Moving border around game
  - Create the a solo played version where you vs an A.I.
  - Create particle explosion that will go off alongside "winner" declaration.
